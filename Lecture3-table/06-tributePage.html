        Since January 2020, Kohli has played 33 Test matches but scored only 1833 runs at a modest average of 33—significantly below his career average, which now sits below 50. His decline is not just about numbers but also about how he has been getting out. A troubling pattern has emerged: Kohli’s struggles against spin, particularly left-arm orthodox bowlers, have become glaring. Over the last four years, he has been dismissed by left-arm spinners 11 times at an average of just 22.

While right-arm spinners have accounted for 13 of his dismissals in this period, Kohli has still managed 544 runs against them at a respectable average of 42. The real problem lies with left-arm spin—a weakness that has become his Achilles' heel.

Kohli’s issues were on full display during a Test match against New Zealand in Pune. In the first innings, he misjudged a low full-toss from Mitchell Santner, getting bowled. In the second innings, he was trapped on the backfoot by Santner again, visibly frustrated at his poor judgment. Kohli’s inability to pick lengths accurately has been cited by former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar as a technical flaw. “The worrying thing for me was how much he misread the length. The problem is that he wants to get forward to a ball that is not necessarily full,” Manjrekar observed.

What makes these dismissals concerning is not just that Kohli is getting out to spinners but how he is getting out. Of the 24 times he has fallen to spin in the last four years, 16 dismissals—67%—have been either bowled or trapped leg-before-wicket. This suggests that spinners have developed a strategy to target Kohli's defense and exploit a technical flaw.

White-ball cricket: A double-edged sword?
Dinesh Karthik believes that Kohli’s struggles may stem from playing too much white-ball cricket. “In white-ball cricket, you play on better pitches and attack more often. Your ability to defend decreases, and you work less on that aspect,” Karthik remarked. This lack of defensive practice may be hindering Kohli’s ability to adjust in Test cricket, where conditions demand more patience and technique against quality spinners.

Kohli’s past comebacks: Can he do it again?

Kohli is no stranger to overcoming rough patches. During the 2014 tour of England, he faced severe criticism for his inability to tackle seam movement outside the off-stump. However, he sought advice from Sachin Tendulkar, worked on the “forward press,” and returned to form later that year with a stellar Border-Gavaskar Trophy performance. Similarly, Kohli’s redemption tour of England in 2018 and his maiden T20I century in 2022 after a three-year drought highlight his resilience.

However, this time around, his struggles have persisted longer. Despite boldly claiming during IPL 2024 that he had added the slog-sweep to his arsenal, Kohli’s returns against spin have been underwhelming.

Domestic cricket: A potential solution?
Both Karthik and former Indian coach Anil Kumble believe that returning to domestic cricket could help Kohli rediscover his form. “Being in an actual game is more beneficial than practice; just one or two innings could have made a difference,” Kumble suggested. However, the BCCI’s stance on senior players playing domestic cricket remains lenient. Former BCCI secretary Jay Shah stated, “We can't insist on seniors like Kohli to feature in domestic matches.” But with India losing their first home Test series in 12 years, will the board reconsider its approach?

The road ahead: Can Kohli reinvent himself?

Kohli's superstar status has allowed him to maintain his place in the team despite his struggles. However, with India’s recent Test losses and their spin game at a historic low, Kohli’s position may come under scrutiny. He has proven his ability to bounce back from setbacks before, but can he overcome this prolonged slump?

The answer might lie in going back to basics—working on his defense, spending time in domestic cricket, and finding the mental toughness that has defined his career. Whether Kohli can make another remarkable comeback remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: cricket fans and critics alike are closely watching the next chapter of this all-time great’s journey.

        Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the
        creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel
        for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control
        system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland.
        He studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he
        developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the
        Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the
        world, powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
